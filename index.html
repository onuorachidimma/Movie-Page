    <h3>Year Released(2022)</h3>
    <p>Anikulapo is a movie with a storyline about a fortunate young man who is fancied by powerful women and members of the kingdoms he finds himself. He is a beloved trader who finds favour in the eye of the queen and other women. His intransigence with the queen is however, found out and he’s banished and nearly killed. An encounter with the mystic, aided by his wife, led him to possess powers to raise people from the dead. He becomes so famous, rich and powerful that he begins to carry his shoulders too high. This, coupled with his love triangle occasioned by greed for women, makes him hurt his first wife (the former queen) so badly. The former queen had to leave her life of affluence to follow Saro just for the sake of love. Saro didn’t reciprocate this, but only used her for other ends- women.</p>
